## 📘 Summary

This is a conceptual framework for an interactive, public-space digital storytelling system using QR codes and geolocation-based experiences. The idea is to transform parks, libraries, or neighborhoods into discovery zones where users scan QR codes to unlock digital content like stories, images, or files, which are saved in a personal digital album.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To inspire curiosity, movement, and reflection by blending physical spaces with meaningful digital content. The system should promote exploration, learning, and emotional connection through storytelling.

---

## 📱 Core Features

- 📍 QR codes placed in physical locations (e.g., trees, benches, statues).
- 📸 Unlock digital content (images, audio, text, or video) by scanning the QR.
- 🗂️ Save discoveries in a digital "album" per user.
- 🧭 Progress system that tracks how many QRs a user has unlocked.
- 🔐 Secure, clean interface to prevent malicious perception.
- 🌟 Optional: Inspirational content like biographies (e.g., Aaron Swartz) to encourage reflection.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation (optional)

- Backend: Firebase / Supabase
- Frontend: React Native / Flutter
- QR logic: Each QR linked to a unique ID and stored asset
- Authentication: Optional or anonymous with local storage
